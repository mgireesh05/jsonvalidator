# jsonvalidator
As expected, this validates the JSON response from a REST API. 
This can also extract JSON objects from a static web page containing REST API documentation and validate that as well.

# Usage
	1. Set the URL to be validated though "inputUrl" in config.json
	2. Run $node jsonvalidator.js
